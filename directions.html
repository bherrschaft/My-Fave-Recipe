        <h1>Step by Step Directions to Make Chocolate Chip Cookies</h1>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the Oven:</strong> Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Mix the Wet Ingredients:</strong> In a large bowl, cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until smooth and creamy. Beat in the eggs <i>one at a time</i>, then stir in the vanilla.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Combine Dry Ingredients:</strong> In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Combine Wet and Dry Mixtures:</strong> Gradually blend the dry ingredients into the wet mixture. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand using a wooden spoon.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Form the Cookies:</strong> <i>Drop rounded</i> tablespoonfuls of the dough onto the prepared baking sheets. Leave about 2 inches between each cookie.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly browned. The centers will still look soft, but they will firm up as the cookies cool.</p></li>
            <li><strong>Cool and Enjoy:</strong> Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely. Enjoy warm or store in an airtight container.</p></li>
        </ol>


        <h2>Baking Tips</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Butter Temperature:</strong> <i>Make sure</i> your butter is softened to room temperature for easy mixing.</li>
            <li><strong>Chilling the Dough:</strong> For thicker cookies, chill the dough for 30 minutes before baking.</li>
            <li><strong>Even Baking:</strong> Rotate the baking sheets halfway through the baking time for even cooking.</li>
